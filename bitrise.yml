        description: |-
          To prevent step testing issues, like referencing relative
          files with just './some-file' in the step's code, which would
          work for testing the step from this directory directly
          but would break if the step is included in another `bitrise.yml`.

          The example input has a default value,
          you can overwrite it if you want to, just like we did below,
          but the step would use the default value specified in the `step.yml`
          file if you would not specify another value.
        inputs:
        - wti_api_key: "Your API Key"
        - wti_working_directory: "."

        is_always_run: true

            rm -r _tmp >/dev/null 2>&1
            exit 0
